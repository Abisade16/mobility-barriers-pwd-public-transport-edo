# Mobility Barriers PWD Public Transport Edo- Research Case Study
Survey data analysis  
PWD: People With Disability

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of survey data to address predefined research questions. The goal was to apply appropriate statistical methods and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Project Context
This analysis was conducted as part of an academic research project. My role focused on statistical analysis and interpretation of results. I was not the principal investigator or author of the full study.

## Research Questions
1. Exploring the socio-economic characteristics
2. What assistive devices are commonly used and by disability types?
3. What are the travel patterns by each disability type?
4. Is the choice of travel mode used by PWD influenced by age, income status and disability type?
5. Are the public road transport infrastructure barriers experienced among PWDs influenced by age, disability types, and locations?
6. Are the choice of mobility coping strategies adopted PWDs influenced by socio-demographic characteristics?
7. Is the frequency of social participation (work, schooling, recreation, leisure, religious center etc.) influenced by travel cost, travel distance, waiting time, income level and age?

## Data Description
The dataset consists of survey responses collected from Edo. Variables include demographic information, key indicators related to the research questions, and outcome measures.
(The dataset is not publicly shared.)

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Cross-tabulation
- Inferential analysis (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing)

## Key Findings (High-Level)
- The choice of travel mode used among PWDs is significantly influenced by age and income status but not disability type.
- There is a significant difference in the public road transport infrastructure barriers experienced by PWDs across different age groups, disability types, and locations.
- The choice of mobility coping strategies adopted by PWDs is significantly influenced by socio-demographic characteristics.
-  The frequency of social participation by PLWDs is significantly influenced by travel cost, travel distance, and waiting time but not age.

## Tools Used
